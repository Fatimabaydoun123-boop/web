            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Our story begins with the idea of making the lebanese cuisine an international one and be make it stands as one 
                of the most popular cuisines in the world. We started our journey in 2010 with a small restaurant in the heart of
                Beirut, Lebanon. We started with a small menu that includes the most popular lebanese dishes. We quickly started
                as we had the desire of letting  these tastefull dishes reach the out of lebanon searching for an idea that will let people that are intersted
                in other cuisines also try our mixes and here it was we chose the japan kitchen to be our mutual menu 
                and to transfer our culture to the japanese culture.
